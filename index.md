# Rope System
### I implemented a rope system from scratch for a 2D game.
#### In order to achieve this effect, I researched possible solutions and ended up with a spring-mass alike system.

# Tool: Feedbacks System
### A system to synchronize game events and vfx.
- Different modules (GameObject, Unity Events, Particle System, Cinemachine...).
- Different actions for each module (Set Active, Play, Switch Color, Shake...).
- Used to create the different effects for the [Game Feel Task](#game-feel-task).

# Tool: Event System
### I implemented an event system to create event objects and instances from the editor.
- With this tool, you can create, edit and remove event objects from editor in a designer-friendly way.
- Events are created with a name, a list of parameters and an icon. Instances of events are created as Scriptable Objects with the selected icon.
- Used to create the different events (for example, when switching the projectile type) for the  [Game Feel Task](#game-feel-task).
