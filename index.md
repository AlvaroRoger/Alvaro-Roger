# Junior Technical Artist
### I am a generalist game progammer looking forward to start my professional career as technical artist!
### Take a look at some of my work ^^

## Rope Physics System
### I implemented a rope physics system from scratch for a 2D game.
- Spring-mass alike rope realistic system.
- Rope collisions (with optimization options).
- Wind force.

</p>

## Tool: Feedbacks System
### A system to synchronize game events and vfx.
- Component-based. Different modules based on (GameObject, Unity Events, Particle System, Cinemachine...).
- Different actions for each module (Set Active, Play, Switch Color, Shake...).
- Used to create the different effects for the [Game Feel Task](#game-feel-task).

</p>

## Tool: Event System
### Implemented an event system to create event objects and instances from the editor.
- With this tool, you can create, edit and remove event objects from editor in a designer-friendly way.
- Events are created with a name, a list of parameters and an icon. Instances of events are created as Scriptable Objects with the selected icon.
- Used to create the different events (for example, when switching the projectile type) for the  [Game Feel Task](#game-feel-task).

## Tool: Save System
### Save system ready to save in all platforms
- Abstracted from gameplay code.
- Optimized: load and save by types, to reduce time and memory use.
- Easy to configure and debug from editor.

</p>

## Tool: Procedural Path Generation
### Optimized algorithm to find networks of paths.
- Backtracking algorithm.
- Setup parameters: number of floors, global branch percentage, branch percentage multiplier by depth (with an animation curve)...
- Every path meets the designer's rules.

## Game Feel Task
### Task I made for a gameplay programmer position.
#### They gave me a simple scene with the standard pipeline and some models and asked me to create some "game feel" out of that.
- Decided to create some gameplay, so it could feel natural.
- Migrated the project to Universal Render Pipeline.
- Created some particles and shaders to give more feedback to the player about what she can do.

## Miaumba
### PvP local game where two cats fight for staying on the top of a falling toast! (wow so cool)
- Designed and programmed the game.
- Implemented wind and ground pound effects.
- Solved movement huge problems.
  #### [Play the game!](https://alvaro-roger.itch.io/miaumba-sgdjam2)
