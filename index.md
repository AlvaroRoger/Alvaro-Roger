# Rope System
## I implemented a rope system from scratch for a 2D game.
### In order to achieve this effect, I researched possible solutions. At first, I thought about using Unity's physics system. The problem was that it would carry some limitation we were not willing to accept. So I found out about spring-mass model. It is basically a really used model for simulating clothes. The problem is that it is really expensive, so I had to adapt it a little bit.
### I could not have done it without the help of both the lead artist and the technical artist. They made many suggestions in order to improve the effect. For example, the lead artist told me that when leaving the rope, the character has to make some force  against the rope in order to impulse herself. And the rope must be tensioned from the beginning of the rope to the character's hand, due to the force applied by her mass. To achieve this, I add an "associated mass" parameter to each of the rope nodes.
### I also added wind force and some optimization options relative to the number of nodes, collision handling and the rope's renderer and collider update rate.
